  ```
  SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
  TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
  LEOS_FOODS_CIF=your-cif
  ```

#### Phase 3: Deployment & Testing
- [ ] **3.1** Click "Create Web Service"
- [ ] **3.2** Monitor build logs for successful completion
- [ ] **3.3** Verify service URL (update WEBHOOK_BASE_URL if different)
- [ ] **3.4** Test endpoints:
  - [ ] `GET /health` - Should return 200 with database connected
  - [ ] `GET /ping` - Should return pong with timestamp  
  - [ ] `GET /metrics` - Should return detailed metrics
  - [ ] `POST /webhook/telegram` - Should accept webhook calls

#### Phase 4: Webhook Configuration
- [ ] **4.1** Update Telegram webhook URL:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook \
       -d url=https://your-actual-service-url.onrender.com/webhook/telegram
  ```
- [ ] **4.2** Test Telegram bot responds to commands
- [ ] **4.3** Test file upload processing
- [ ] **4.4** Verify database writes working

### Post-Deployment Setup

#### Phase 5: Monitoring & Keep-Alive
- [ ] **5.1** Set up external monitoring service (choose one):
  - [ ] UptimeRobot (free: 50 monitors)
  - [ ] Pingdom (free: 1 monitor)  
  - [ ] Better Stack (free plan)
  
- [ ] **5.2** Configure monitor settings:
  ```
  URL: https://your-service-url.onrender.com/ping
  Method: GET
  Interval: 5 minutes
  Timeout: 30 seconds
  ```

- [ ] **5.3** Verify keep-alive service status:
  ```bash
  curl https://your-service-url.onrender.com/health | jq '.services.keepAlive'
  ```

#### Phase 6: Performance Validation
- [ ] **6.1** Response time validation:
  - [ ] Health check: < 2 seconds
  - [ ] Database queries: < 1 second
  - [ ] File processing: < 10 seconds
  
- [ ] **6.2** Resource usage check:
  ```bash
  curl https://your-service-url.onrender.com/metrics | jq '.memory.usagePercent'
  # Should be < 80%
  ```

- [ ] **6.3** Free tier usage monitoring:
  ```bash
  curl https://your-service-url.onrender.com/metrics | jq '.renderFreeTier'
  # Track monthly hours used
  ```

#### Phase 7: Production Testing
- [ ] **7.1** End-to-end order processing test:
  - [ ] Send PDF to Telegram bot
  - [ ] Verify order extracted and saved
  - [ ] Check Excel export generation
  
- [ ] **7.2** Load testing (free tier limits):
  - [ ] Test 10 concurrent requests
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage during processing
  - [ ] Verify no crashes under load

- [ ] **7.3** Error handling verification:
  - [ ] Test with invalid PDF
  - [ ] Test with network disconnection
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation

### Free Tier Optimization Checklist

#### Resource Management
- [ ] Memory usage stays below 400MB during normal operation
- [ ] Response times under 3 seconds for all endpoints
- [ ] Keep-alive prevents sleeping during business hours (8 AM - 8 PM CET)
- [ ] Logging optimized to reduce I/O overhead

#### Cost Controls
- [ ] AI API usage optimized:
  - [ ] Gemini 2.0 Flash for JSON processing (cheap)
  - [ ] GPT-4o only for image analysis (when needed)
  - [ ] Fallback chains configured
- [ ] Database connection pooling active
- [ ] File cleanup after processing
- [ ] Compressed logging in production

#### Monitoring Alerts
- [ ] Memory usage > 80% alert
- [ ] Monthly hours > 600 (80% of 750) alert
- [ ] Service down alert
- [ ] Database connection failures alert

### Emergency Procedures

#### Service Issues
