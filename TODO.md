## Review Section

### Completed Changes:

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup ‚úÖ (Completed)
- Created complete project structure with proper ES module configuration
- Installed and configured all dependencies (Express, Supabase, AI SDKs, etc.)
- Designed robust database schema with proper indexes and relationships
- Set up comprehensive environment configuration with .env template
- Built Express server with health checks, logging, and error handling
- Created database models with full CRUD operations and statistics
- Implemented Winston logging system with file rotation

#### Phase 2: Input Channel Setup ‚úÖ (Completed)
- Built Outlook webhook endpoint with file upload support (multer)
- Created Telegram webhook endpoint with comprehensive message type handling
- Implemented Telegram bot configuration with webhook management
- Built intelligent content detection system that classifies:
  - Spanish order tables (primary target format)
  - PDF documents, images, web URLs
  - Text content with order patterns
  - File attachments with proper validation
- Added comprehensive validation system using Joi
- Implemented file upload handling with security validation
- Created test suite for all webhook endpoints

### Challenges Encountered:
- Initial dependency version conflicts resolved (Anthropic SDK, Multer)
- Database connection requires real Supabase credentials (expected)
- Webhook testing automated with proper server lifecycle management

### Performance Notes:
- Content detection system uses regex patterns for Spanish order recognition
- File validation includes mime type verification and security checks
- Structured logging provides detailed performance metrics
- Processing priority system optimizes AI resource usage

### Architecture Decisions:
- **ES Modules**: Modern JavaScript with import/export syntax
- **Webhook-First**: Asynchronous processing via webhooks vs polling
- **Content Detection**: Smart routing to appropriate AI processors
- **Validation Layers**: Input validation, file validation, content validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with structured logging
- **File Management**: Secure upload handling with automatic cleanup

#### AI Architecture Update ‚úÖ (Completed)
**Updated AI Processing Stack per user requirements:**
- **GPT-4 Vision**: Visual analysis only (PDFs, images, screenshots)
- **DeepSeek R1**: Primary text processing and conversational agent
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Fallback for text processing when DeepSeek fails
- **Architecture Benefits**: Specialized AI for specific tasks, cost optimization
- **Content Detection**: Updated to route content to appropriate AI processor
- **Testing**: All AI providers configured and tested successfully

#### Phase 3: AI Processing Engine ‚úÖ (Completed)
**Successfully implemented comprehensive AI processing system:**
- **DeepSeek R1 Integration**: Primary text processing with JSON output parsing
- **GPT-4 Vision Ready**: Visual analysis for PDFs and images (when image conversion available)
- **Web Scraping Module**: Puppeteer-based scraping with AI content analysis
