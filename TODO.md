- [ ] 6.3 Error handling verification and edge case testing
- [ ] 6.4 Security testing (input validation, rate limiting)
- [ ] 6.5 Load testing for 400 orders/month capacity

## Phase 7: Deployment & Monitoring üöÄ
- [x] 7.1 Prepare deployment configuration (Dockerfile, Procfile, .dockerignore)
- [x] 7.2 Setup environment variables for production (.env.example)

## Review Section

### Completed Changes:

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup ‚úÖ (Completed)
- Created complete project structure with proper ES module configuration
- Installed and configured all dependencies (Express, Supabase, AI SDKs, etc.)
- Designed robust database schema with proper indexes and relationships
- Set up comprehensive environment configuration with .env template
- Built Express server with health checks, logging, and error handling
- Created database models with full CRUD operations and statistics
- Implemented Winston logging system with file rotation

#### Phase 2: Input Channel Setup ‚úÖ (Completed)
- Built Outlook webhook endpoint with file upload support (multer)
- Created Telegram webhook endpoint with comprehensive message type handling
- Implemented Telegram bot configuration with webhook management
- Built intelligent content detection system that classifies:
  - Spanish order tables (primary target format)
  - PDF documents, images, web URLs
  - Text content with order patterns
  - File attachments with proper validation
- Added comprehensive validation system using Joi
- Implemented file upload handling with security validation
- Created test suite for all webhook endpoints

### Challenges Encountered:
- Initial dependency version conflicts resolved (Anthropic SDK, Multer)
- Database connection requires real Supabase credentials (expected)
- Webhook testing automated with proper server lifecycle management

### Performance Notes:
- Content detection system uses regex patterns for Spanish order recognition
- File validation includes mime type verification and security checks
- Structured logging provides detailed performance metrics
- Processing priority system optimizes AI resource usage

### Architecture Decisions:
- **ES Modules**: Modern JavaScript with import/export syntax
- **Webhook-First**: Asynchronous processing via webhooks vs polling
- **Content Detection**: Smart routing to appropriate AI processors

- **Testing**: Providers configured and verified in local runs

#### Phase 3: AI Processing Engine ‚úÖ (Completed)
