# Deployment Cost Analysis - Leo Order Processing System

## Railway Deployment Costs (Recommended)

### **Starter Plan - $5/month**
- **Compute**: 512MB RAM, 1 vCPU
- **Storage**: 1GB persistent disk
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB outbound transfer
- **Always-on**: No sleep, perfect for webhooks
- **Builds**: Unlimited
- **Custom domains**: Included

### **Usage Estimate for 400 orders/month**
```
Monthly Processing Load:
├── 400 orders × 10s avg processing = 4,000s compute time
├── ~13 orders/day × 24/7 webhook availability
├── File uploads: ~800MB/month (2MB avg per order)
├── Database calls: ~8,000 requests/month (20 per order)
├── AI API calls: ~1,600 requests/month (4 per order)
└── Outbound bandwidth: ~15GB/month
```

**Conclusion**: Well within Starter plan limits with 75% headroom.

## Total Monthly Costs Breakdown

### **Core Infrastructure**
```
Railway Starter Plan          $5.00
Domain (optional)             $1.00/month (Cloudflare)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Infrastructure Subtotal:     $6.00/month
```

### **External Services (Variable)**
```
Supabase (Database):
├── Free tier: 500MB storage, 50,000 requests/month
├── Usage: ~100MB storage, 8,000 requests/month
└── Cost: $0.00 ✅ (within free tier)

OpenAI API (GPT-4o):
├── PDF/Image processing: ~800 requests/month
├── Est. cost: $0.03 per 1K tokens × 1M tokens
└── Cost: ~$30.00/month

Google Gemini API:
├── JSON structuring: ~800 requests/month  
├── Free tier: 15 requests/minute
└── Cost: $0.00 ✅ (within free tier)

Telegram Bot API:
└── Cost: $0.00 ✅ (free)

Microsoft Graph API:
└── Cost: $0.00 ✅ (free tier sufficient)
```

### **Total Estimated Monthly Cost**
```
Infrastructure:     $6.00
OpenAI API:        $30.00
Other APIs:         $0.00
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TOTAL:            ~$36.00/month
```

### **Cost per Order**
```
$36.00 ÷ 400 orders = $0.09 per order
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### **Immediate Optimizations**
1. **AI Model Selection**:
   - Use Gemini 2.0 Flash (free) for JSON structuring
   - Use GPT-4o-mini ($0.002/1K tokens) for fallback text processing
   - Reserve GPT-4o for complex PDF/image analysis only

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache product lookups to reduce AI calls
   - Implement request deduplication
   - Store processed PDF text to avoid reprocessing

3. **Request Batching**:
   - Batch multiple small requests
   - Use streaming for large responses
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### **Advanced Optimizations**
1. **Regional Deployment**: Frankfurt region for EU customers
2. **CDN Integration**: Cloudflare for static assets (free tier)
3. **Database Optimization**: Proper indexing, connection pooling
4. **Background Jobs**: Queue non-urgent processing

### **Scaling Considerations**
```
Current capacity (Starter Plan):
├── 400 orders/month: 75% headroom
├── 1,000 orders/month: Would need Pro plan ($20/month)
└── 2,000+ orders/month: Consider dedicated infrastructure
```

## Risk Assessment

### **High Confidence Risks**
- **OpenAI API costs**: Could spike with complex PDFs
- **Supabase storage**: May exceed free tier with growth

### **Medium Confidence Risks**  
- **Railway resource limits**: Memory usage with heavy PDF processing
- **Rate limiting**: AI API limits during traffic spikes

### **Mitigation Strategies**
1. **Cost Monitoring**: Railway usage alerts + OpenAI spending limits
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Fallback to simpler processing on errors
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with partial data extraction
4. **Auto-scaling**: Queue-based processing for traffic spikes

## Recommendations

### **Phase 1: MVP Deployment (Immediate)**
- Deploy to Railway Starter ($5/month)
- Configure all monitoring and alerting
- Implement cost tracking dashboards
- Use conservative AI model selection

### **Phase 2: Production Hardening (1-2 months)**
- Add CDN and caching layers
- Implement advanced error handling
- Set up comprehensive logging
- Create automated backup strategies

### **Phase 3: Scale Optimization (3-6 months)**
- Monitor actual usage patterns
- Optimize based on real data
- Consider multi-region deployment
- Evaluate cost-performance trade-offs

**Expected ROI**: At $0.09/order, system pays for itself with minimal efficiency gains in order processing workflow.
