# Render HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" Fix

## Problem Description
The Leo order processing system deployed successfully to Render but returns HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests" errors, preventing normal operation.

## Root Cause Analysis
The HTTP 429 error is caused by a cascade of rapid restart attempts creating excessive API requests:

1. **Keep-Alive Service Over-Pinging**: Service attempts database pings every 10 minutes
2. **Missing Environment Variables**: `RENDER_FREE_TIER` not set, causing incorrect service behavior
3. **Startup Validation Loop**: Complex environment validation triggers during each restart
4. **Memory Exhaustion**: App hits 512MB free tier limit and gets restarted repeatedly
5. **Rate Limiting**: External services (Supabase, AI APIs) throttle excessive requests

## Fix Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Variables Update (in Render Dashboard)
Add/update these environment variables:

```
RENDER_FREE_TIER=false          # Disable keep-alive initially
LOG_LEVEL=error                 # Reduce startup logging
STARTUP_DELAY=5000              # 5-second startup delay
MEMORY_LIMIT=400                # Stay under 512MB limit
```

### Step 2: Code Optimizations

#### A. App Startup (src/app.js)
- Add startup delay to prevent rapid restarts
- Implement graceful error handling
- Reduce memory usage during initialization

#### B. Keep-Alive Service (src/services/keep-alive.js) 
- Increase ping intervals from 10 to 15 minutes
- Add exponential backoff for failed pings
- Make database pings optional during startup

#### C. Environment Validation (src/config/env-validator.js)
- Make validation less strict during startup
- Add timeout for validation process
- Reduce logging verbosity

#### D. Package.json Scripts
- Optimize memory allocation for production
- Add startup timeout handling
- Include proper Node.js flags

### Step 3: Deployment Process

1. **Commit fixes** to GitHub repository
2. **Monitor Render logs** during automatic deployment
3. **Test health endpoint** for successful startup
4. **Gradually re-enable services** once stable

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Application starts without 429 errors
2. ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly (`/health`)
3. ✅ Memory usage stays under 400MB
4. ✅ No rapid restart cycles in Render logs
5. ✅ Database connections work properly

## Post-Fix Configuration

Once stable, update environment variables:
```
RENDER_FREE_TIER=true           # Re-enable keep-alive
LOG_LEVEL=info                  # Restore normal logging
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Regular monitoring** of memory usage and API requests
2. **Environment variable validation** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Load testing** before production deployments
4. **Documentation** of all Render-specific configurations

## Emergency Rollback

If fixes don't work:
1. Set `RENDER_FREE_TIER=false` immediately
2. Revert to previous GitHub commit
3. Use local database fallback while troubleshooting
